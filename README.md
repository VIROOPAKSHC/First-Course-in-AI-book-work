# First-Course-in-AI-book-work
This repository holds the work done for the course Artificial Intelligence and aspects related to book by Prof. Deepak Khemani on AI. The algorithms implemented have been seen to it that they produce the desired result according to the book and the examples in it. However, the solutions for the exercises might not have been efficient in the view that they were written by an amateur in AI. If you find any mistakes or have a better solution in terms of complexity or solution please fork the repo and raise a pull request. Thanks and Cheers!! Happy Learning
